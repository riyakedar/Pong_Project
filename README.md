Creating a Pong game in Python using the `turtle` module is a fun project. It involves handling paddle movement, ball dynamics, collision detection, and a scoring system. Below is a step-by-step guide to create the Pong game.

### Steps to Build the Pong Game:

1. **Set up the Game Screen**: The screen will be created using the `turtle` module, and we'll set up its width and height.
2. **Create the Paddles**: Two paddles will be created using the turtle shape. One will be controlled by the player and the other by the computer.
3. **Create the Ball**: The ball will move automatically and bounce off the walls and paddles.
4. **Movement and Control**: The player will control the left paddle using the keyboard.
5. **Collision Detection**: The ball will bounce off the paddles and walls.
6. **Scoring System**: A simple scoring system will keep track of player and computer points.

### Key Features:
1. **Paddle Control**: The left paddle can be controlled using the `W` (up) and `S` (down) keys.
2. **Ball Movement**: The ball moves autonomously, bouncing off the top and bottom walls. It also detects collisions with paddles.
3. **Scoring System**: When the ball crosses the screen's left or right side, a point is awarded, and the score is updated.
4. **AI for Right Paddle**: The right paddle is controlled by AI, which follows the ball's movement with a basic approach to mimic the opponent.

### How to Run the Game:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Copy the code above into a Python file, for example, `pong_game.py`.
3. Run the file by executing `python pong_game.py` in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Control the left paddle using the `W` and `S` keys. Watch the game in action!

This is a basic version of the game.
